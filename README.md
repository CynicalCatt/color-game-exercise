# Color Game Exercise
Link to project page: https://cynicalcatt.github.io/color-game-exercise/

Completed color game exercise for a course I'm currently undertaking. All done using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

How well do you know your RGB color codes? That's what you'll find out with this game.

Don't expect anything magical. But do have fun if you decide to play!

**Note:** I plan to add some more features to this as I get better at programming. Some of the features I'm considering on implementing are as follows:
- Two player system
- Score keeping
- Win/lose system
